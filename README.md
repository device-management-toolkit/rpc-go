RPC is used for activation, deactivation, maintenance, and status of an AMT device
The Remote Provisioning Client (RPC) is an application that assists with activation, configuration, and maintenance of for IntelÂ® AMT devices. RPC provides source code that must be compiled into a binary to run or library for integration with other client applications.

## Prerequisites

- [Golang](https://go.dev/dl/)

## Build

### Windows

#### As executable:

```
go build -o rpc.exe ./cmd/rpc/main.go
```

#### As Library:

```
go build -buildmode=c-shared -o rpc.dll ./cmd/rpc
```

### Linux

#### As executable:

```
go build -o rpc ./cmd/rpc/main.go
```

#### As Library:

```
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -buildmode=c-shared -o librpc.so ./cmd/rpc
```

### Docker image

```bash
docker build -t rpc-go:latest .
```

## Run

Install the executable on a target device and then run from a terminal/shell
command line with <b>adminstrator privileges</b>.

For usage, call the executable with no additional parameters.

### Configuration file

RPC can preload defaults from a YAML configuration file (default: `config.yaml` in the working directory or passed explicitly via `--config <path>`).

See `config.sample.yaml` for a fully documented example containing every command and flag. Typical workflow:

1. Copy the sample: `cp config.sample.yaml config.yaml` (or on Windows `copy config.sample.yaml config.yaml`).
2. Edit only the sections you need (e.g. set `configure: sync-clock: password:` or activation parameters).
3. Run a command using the file:

```shell
rpc --config config.yaml configure sync-clock
```

CLI flags and environment variables always override values loaded from the file.

Sensitive values (passwords, tokens) can also be provided via environment variables (see flag `env:` tags in code) instead of storing in plaintext YAML.

#### Global AMT Password

You can now supply a single global AMT admin password once via either:

```
rpc --amt-password <pass> <command> ...
```

or environment variable:

```
set AMT_PASSWORD=<pass>   # Windows PowerShell
export AMT_PASSWORD=<pass> # Linux/macOS
```

All commands that require an AMT password will use this value automatically unless a per-command `--password` is explicitly provided (legacy behavior kept for backward compatibility). The sample config (`config.sample.yaml`) reflects this by using a top-level `amt-password:` key instead of repeating `password:` under each command section.

### Windows

```shell
.\rpc
```

### Linux

```bash
sudo ./rpc
```

### Docker

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it --device /dev/mei0 rpc-go:latest
```

# Dev tips for passing CI Checks

- Ensure code is formatted correctly with `gofumpt -l -w -extra ./`
- Ensure all unit tests pass with `go test ./...`
- Ensure code has been linted with `docker run --rm -v ${pwd}:/app -w /app golangci/golangci-lint:latest golangci-lint run -v`
